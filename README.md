## Introduction

The traffic stop is known as one of the most common ways in which the public interacts with the police. The Stanford Open Policing Project collected the police stops data from state to state and published their nationwide analysis, along with the datasets. However, San Francisco, as one of the largest U.S. cities, has its unique complexity regarding demographics, culture, and political environment. Also, considering the decentralized nature of policing in the United States, it is worth exploring the police stops in San Francisco solely by using the datasets provided by the Stanford Open Policing Project.

San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) releases the police stop report regularly on its website, which has various visualizations. However, these visualizations are far from optimal which potentially compromises the public access to the police stop data.

In this report, we redesigned the visualizations in the SFPD report as the first step. Then, we further analyzed the information obtained from the redesigned visualizations. By answering the four Ws - How, Who, When, and Where of police stops, we gained a better understanding of police work conducted in San Francisco.

It should be noted that, although the dataset used in the final project report is largely the same with the one used in the SFPD, they are indeed different in several ways, such as different time ranges, zoning methods etc. Also, some of the police stop figures are missing in the SFPD report. In this case, we used another figure to showcase the drawbacks of visualization in the SFPD report. For example, the linegraph of police stop over time is missing in the SFPD report. To remedy this, we chose the linegraph of uses of force in the report instead of for comparison.
